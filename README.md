# Shiny-App-ML-Data-Cleaner

Initial commit: Added Shiny app for data cleaning and exploratory analysis

- Upload or select built-in datasets (iris, mtcars, ToothGrowth)
- Drop selected variables dynamically
- Convert variables between numeric and factor
- Analyze dependent variable (distribution or proportions)
- Show dataset structure, dimensions, summary, and missing values
- Perform bivariate analysis with appropriate tests:
  * Pearson correlation (num ~ num)
  * T-test / ANOVA (num ~ cat or cat ~ num)
  * Chi-square / Fisher's exact (cat ~ cat)
- Display significance levels using p-value stars
- Export clean report in HTML or PDF format, with optional code inclusion

# To Do:
- Ability to handle Date column and create dummy variable if needed.
- Test and Train Split and save that data in director

# Other related project:
## Project 2: Prediction App:
- Create another app for building Machine learning models using dropdown.
- Where the app can do hyperparameter tunning and give optimal parameter set.
- Do cross validation.
- Do testing.
- Show appropriate performance metrics.
- Recommend the best model.

## Project 3: Think how to create an interesting AI agent for data cleaning, or model development or for recommendation.
